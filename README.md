A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Scene1, Scene2, Scene3, Scene4, Scene9, Scene5, Scene6
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: S0, Intro, Title, Outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - different uses for showMessage
Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: medow, forest, deep woods, lake
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: firefly in the forest, and the dog in the lake
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: firefly in the forest, and the dog in the lake
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: firefly in the forest, and the dog in the lake
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: player shakes, bugs move
